## Overview

Basic rating system which allows the user to select and submit a rating of their choice.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

Started off with basic HTML formatting before transitioning into a basic flexbox layout. Then, I added the css styling for the rating component before styling the thank you component. Finally, I added the JS and active states.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that on mobile devices, the 'hover' property for elements doesn't really work. Therefore, it's best to avoid hover elements for mobile devices.

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 500px) {
    .number:hover {
        cursor: pointer;
        background-color: hsl(25, 97%, 53%);
        color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 85%);
    }
    
    .button:hover {
        cursor: pointer;
        background-color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 85%);
        color:hsl(25, 97%, 53%)
    }
}
```

I learned more about gradients in css and how to create directional ones.

```css
.rating__container {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, hsl(213, 19%, 18%), 25%, hsla(213, 19%, 18%, 50%));
}
```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I would like to practice with more complex JavaScript and it's interactions with mobile devices.
